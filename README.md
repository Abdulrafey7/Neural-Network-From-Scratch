# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple **neural network from scratch using NumPy**, without relying on ML frameworks. It covers **forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, and weight updates**, providing a deeper understanding of how neural networks actually work.

## 🚀 Features
- Implemented fully in Python & NumPy
- Forward & backward propagation
- Gradient descent weight updates
- Activation functions

## 📊 Results
- Successful training of a simple NN on synthetic datasets
- Gained insights into the inner mechanics of deep learning models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrafey7/Neural-Network-From-Scratch.git
cd Neural-Network-From-Scratch
jupyter notebook
